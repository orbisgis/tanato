/* 
 * TANATO  is a library dedicated to the modelling of water pathways based on 
 * triangulate irregular network. TANATO takes into account anthropogenic and 
 * natural artifacts to evaluate their impacts on the watershed response. 
 * It ables to compute watershed, main slope directions and water flow pathways.
 * 
 * This library has been originally created  by Erwan Bocher during his thesis 
 * “Impacts des activités humaines sur le parcours des écoulements de surface dans 
 * un bassin versant bocager : essai de modélisation spatiale. Application au 
 * Bassin versant du Jaudy-Guindy-Bizien (France)”. It has been funded by the 
 * Bassin versant du Jaudy-Guindy-Bizien and Syndicat d’Eau du Trégor.
 * 
 * The new version is developed at French IRSTV institut as part of the 
 * AvuPur project, funded by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche 
 * (ANR) under contract ANR-07-VULN-01.
